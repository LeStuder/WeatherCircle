Data used:
MeteoSwiss. Area-mean temperatures of Switzerland. 
  Northern Switzerland Low, DOI: 10.18751/Climate/Timeseries/CHTM/1.1
Tools used:
- Python \w pandas, matplotlib
- Shotcut

This animation shows how the temperatures deviate from the mean in the northern part of Switzerland since 1864 up until now.
As you can see, the newer rings are further out, showing how climate-change affected temperatures over time.
Almost all temperature-records were set in recent years, which is very worrying.
What I also find interesting is, that swiss winter months are much more affected by climate change than summer months. 
I felt this effect as 2020 was the first year with no snow at the place where I live.
Another thing to notice is February 1929 and 1954 where throughout most of Europe temperatures were 10Â° lower than what they should have been.

This is my very first project with programming python.
I used pandas to rearrange the data and calculate the deviations.
After this, I used matplotlib to plot every individual yeae and save them each as png.
With Shotcut I stuck together all frames to make the clip you're seeing.

All in all, it took me around 30 hours to write no more than 2 A4 sheets of code but it was worth the journey.
As I started programming less than 1 week ago I'm pretty happy with my result.
If someone is interested to take a look at my code: https://github.com/LeStuder/WeatherCircle

Also, please give me some feedback. I already plan to update this with monthly frames instead of yearly so why not implement some more changes?
I'm happy to see you in the comment section
